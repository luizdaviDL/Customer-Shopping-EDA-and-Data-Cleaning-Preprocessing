🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation for Machine Learning

This repository focuses on the data cleaning and preprocessing stage of a data science project, which is a critical foundation for any Machine Learning workflow.

The main objective is to demonstrate a structured and professional approach to preparing raw data, ensuring it is clean, consistent, and ready for future analytical or Machine Learning applications.

🧠 Why data cleaning matters

In real-world data science projects, most of the effort is spent on data preparation.
Before any Exploratory Data Analysis or Machine Learning modeling, it is essential to ensure that:

The data is reliable and consistent

Errors, noise, and anomalies are properly handled

The dataset reflects the real business context

Future models are trained on high-quality data

Well-prepared data leads to more accurate, interpretable, and trustworthy models.
